There’s a lot of jargon in coding that doesn’t make sense to a non-coder or a newcomer. That’s no fun because such jargon intimidates people from making the jump into the wonderful world of code!

That’s why I’m translating a bunch of terms that come up a lot in tech literature and conversations…I want you to learn how to code!
